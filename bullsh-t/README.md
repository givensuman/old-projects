# BULLSH*T

A trivia game with a twist

### How to play

Bullsh\*t is a trivia game. Answer the questions correct and you win the round. But there's a twist: if you don't know the answer, you're not out of luck. If you can convince the other players that you do know the answer -- y'know, bullsh*t -- you win the round all the same.

The game plays out as follows:

- Each round, someone is put in the "hot seat."
- They're given a multiple-choice question, and then have to explain why their answer is correct to all the other players -- even if it isn't.
- If they got the answer correct or can convince at least one other player of their reasoning, they win the round and get to go again.
- The other players' judgement on whether or not the answer was bullsh\*t affects their bullsh*t meter.
- If the answer is wrong and everyone calls bullsh\*t, the player with the most accurate bullsh*t meter gets to answer the next round's question.
- The first player to win the designated number of rounds wins the game!
