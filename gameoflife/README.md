The Game of Life was devised by British mathematician John Conway in the 1970s.

It is a zero-player game featuring grid cells that are 'alive' or 'dead.' The rules of the game are simple:
- If a cell is alive, it will stay alive if it has only 2 or 3 live neighbors.
- If a cell is dead, it stays dead unless it has 3 live neighbors.

The game was originally designed on an infinite surface, but for the purposes of this illustrative app, it is set on a finite grid with a random starting configuration.
You may see dynamic or stable structures emerge from the chaos. You can learn more about these and the game itself [here](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).
